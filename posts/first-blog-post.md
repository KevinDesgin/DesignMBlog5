Editing Stage 
At the beginning of my editing process, I was working very slow as I was still brand new to using the Adobe Premier Pro. However overtime, I was quickly figuring out SOME command which helped shave off time. 

Halfway through the editing stage I soon realised that the footages I collected at first had only filled out a quarter of the two minutes requirement. So I improved by extending the scenes with me either interating with the object or that more object would appear. Then at each end of the different sences, I would transition with a fade to black.  


Feedback Stage 
At this time, my peers has given me plenty of suggestions to improve on my film. Most of them being that I should add more diegetic sounds. However I dicided that I could not add anymore diegetic sounds beside the intro as I think it would runied the pensive vibe when a drum noise is played in the background. 

There were other smalled changes that my peers pointed out. One of them being that I needed more sound in the intro due to empty vibe. I incorporated this by recording the sound of a pen rubbing to incidicate me drawing in the intro. As well as redoing the page flip recording to last longer to fill the empty transition with a l cut between the intro and main. Another small change that another peer pointed out was that the car near the start did not match cut well. Si I quickly fixed up. 

Even after all those edits, my video lasted for exactly 2min and 15sec. So I had to reduce the intro in order for my video to fit the 2min and 10sec max limit.
