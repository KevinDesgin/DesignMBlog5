Editing Stage 
At the beginning of my editing process, I was working very slow as I was still brand new to using the Adobe Premier Pro. However overtime, I was quickly figuring out SOME command which helped shave off time. 

Halfway through the editing stage I soon realised that the footages I collected at first had only filled out a quarter of the two minutes requirement. So I improved by extending the scenes with me either interating with the object or that more object would appear. Then at each end of the different sences, I would transition with a fade to black.
